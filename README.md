# YBVisual

##About
YBVisual is a visual programming platform which aims to improve the accessibility of robots. The framework provides a 'drag-and-drop' programming approach, allowing less technically minded users to create complex robot programs.

##Initial Testing
1) Deploy the project onto the robot

2) Ensure the server.py script is executable:
```
chmod +x \path\server.py
```
3) Launch the server.py script

4) The editor may be accessed by another machine using this format: 
```
HOSTIP:8080
```
